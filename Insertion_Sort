Insertion sort sorts every element to its correct location in every pass. Also called as ONLINE ALGORITHM
*BEST CASE (lowerbound):  O(n)
swapping complexity: O(1)
comparison complexity: O(n)


*WORST CASE (upperbound):  O(n^2)
swapping complexity: O(n^2)
comparison complexity: O(n^2)

*AVERAGE CASE :  O(n^2)
swapping complexity: O(n^2)
comparison complexity: O(n^2)

CODE:
void insert(int arr[], int i)
    {
        //code here
          while(i > 0 && arr[i - 1] > arr[i]){
           int temp = arr[i -1];
           arr[i - 1] = arr[i];
           arr[i] = temp;
           i--;
       }
    }
    
    void insertionSort(int arr[], int n)
    {
        //code here
         for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
          insert(arr , j);
      }
    }
